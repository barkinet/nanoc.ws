title: "Tutorial"
---

This tutorial takes approximately twenty minutes to complete. You need three things in order to follow the tutorial:

a working nanoc installation
: Check out the [Install](/install/) page for details on how to install Ruby, Rubygems and nanoc.

a basic understanding of Ruby
: nanoc uses the Ruby programming language extensively. If you are unfamiliar with Ruby, we recommend [Ruby in Twenty Minutes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/).

a basic understanding of the command line
: nanoc is executed on the command line. If you need to brush up on your command line skills, we recommend [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/).

Create a site
-------------

Create a new site by typing <kbd>create-site</kbd>, followed by the name of the new directory in which you want nanoc to create the site:

<pre><span class="prompt">%</span> <kbd>nanoc create-site tutorial</kbd></pre>

nanoc lists all files being generated as result of this command:

<pre>      <span class="log-create">create</span>  nanoc.yaml
      <span class="log-create">create</span>  Rules
      <span class="log-create">create</span>  content/index.html
      <span class="log-create">create</span>  content/stylesheet.css
      <span class="log-create">create</span>  layouts/default.html
Created a blank nanoc site at 'tutorial'. Enjoy!</pre>

A nanoc-powered site is a directory with a specific structure. The newly generated `tutorial` directory has a handful of files and directories:

<span class="filename">nanoc.yaml</span>
: The YAML file that contains site-wide configuration details.

<span class="filename">Rules</span>
: The Ruby file that describes how pages and assets will be processed.

<span class="filename">content/</span>
: The directory in which pages and assets go.

<span class="filename">layouts/</span>
: The directory that contains layouts, which define the look-and-feel of the site.

<span class="filename">lib/</span>
: The directory that contains custom Ruby code.

We’ll revisit these later on in the tutorial.

Compile the site
----------------

All nanoc commands, except for <span class="command">create-site</span>, require the current working directory to be a nanoc site. <kbd>cd</kbd> into the <span class="filename">tutorial</span> directory, if you haven’t yet done so:

<pre><span class="prompt">%</span> <kbd>cd tutorial</kbd>
<span class="prompt">tutorial%</span></pre>

Every new nanoc site comes with one page, <span class="filename">content/index.html</span>. The content of this page is a HTML snippet rather than a complete HTML file. To generate the full HTML file, compile the site by running <kbd>nanoc</kbd>:

<pre><span class="prompt">tutorial%</span> <kbd>nanoc</kbd></pre>

NOTE: You can also use the <span class="command">nanoc compile</span> command, for which <span class="command">nanoc</span> is a shorthand.

nanoc will tell what is happening during the compilation process:

<pre>Loading site data…
Compiling site…
      <span class="log-create">create</span>  [0.01s] output/index.html

Site compiled in 0.01s.</pre>

nanoc created a file named <span class="filename">index.html</span> in the <span class="filename">output/</span> directory. This is a complete HTML file, as opposed to the snippet in the <span class="filename">content/</span> directory.

Because nanoc generates absolute paths by default, opening the file directly in a web browser will not produce the desired result: links will be broken and the browser won’t be able to find the stylesheet.

The recommended way of previewing a site is using the <kbd>nanoc view</kbd> command, which starts a local web server that mimics a real-world web server. Before you can use this command, install the <span class="productname">adsf</span> gem (_not_ <span class="productname">asdf</span>!) first:

<pre><span class="prompt">tutorial%</span> <kbd>gem install adsf</kbd></pre>

NOTE: {sudo-gem-install}

Now you can start a web server by running <kbd>nanoc view</kbd>:

<pre><span class="prompt">tutorial%</span> <kbd>nanoc view</kbd></pre>

Open a web browser and navigate to <span class="uri">http://localhost:3000/</span>. You’ll see something like this:

<figure class="fullwidth">
	<img src="/assets/images/tutorial/default-site.png"
	     alt="Screenshot of what a brand new nanoc site looks like">
	<figcaption>Screenshot of what a brand new nanoc site looks like</figcaption>
</figure>

Edit the home page
------------------

Pages and assets, commonly referred to as <span class="firstterm">items</span>, are stored in the <span class="filename">content/</span> directory. Open the <span class="filename">content/index.html</span> file:

<pre><code>---
title: Home
---

&lt;h1>A Brand New nanoc Site&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>You’ve just created a new nanoc site. The page you are looking at right now is the home page for your site. To get started, consider replacing this default homepage with your own customized homepage. Some pointers on how to do so:&lt;/p>

…</code></pre>

Add a paragraph somewhere in the file. I recommend adding the following:

<pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;p>Another nanoc convert! Master will be pleased.&lt;/p>
</code></pre>

Recompile the site by running <kbd>nanoc</kbd>:

<pre><span class="prompt">tutorial%</span> <kbd>nanoc</kbd>
Loading site data…
Compiling site…
      <span class="log-update">update</span>  [0.01s] output/index.html

Site compiled in 0.01s.
<span class="prompt">tutorial%</span> </pre>

Make sure that the preview server (<kbd>nanoc view</kbd>) is still running, and reload <span class="uri">http://localhost:3000/</span> in your browser. You’ll see the page and the newly added paragraph.

Items, such as this home page, can contain metadata. This metadata is defined in the <span class="firstterm">frontmatter</span> of a file. The home page’s frontmatter is quite simple:

<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
title: Home
---</code></pre>

NOTE: The term <span class="firstterm">metadata section</span> is often used instead of frontmatter in the context of nanoc. Other static site generators, such as Jekyll, use the term frontmatter almost exclusively.

The frontmatter is formatted as YAML. If you are unfamiliar with YAML, check out the [YAML cookbook](http://www.yaml.org/YAML_for_ruby.html). There are no pre-defined attributes in nanoc, and you are free to invent your own attributes.

Change the value of the <span class="attribute">title</span> attribute to something else:

<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
title: "Denis’ Guide to Awesomeness"
---</code></pre>

Recompile the site and reload <span class="uri">http://localhost:3000/</span> in your browser. You will see that the browser’s title bar displays the new page title now. (The mechanism behind this will be explained in the [Customize the layout](#customize-the-layout) section below.)

Add a page
----------

Create a file named <span class="filename">content/about.html</span> and paste in the following content:

    #!html
    ---
    title: "About me and my cats"
    ---

    <h1>My cute little "About" page</h1>

    <p>This is the about page for my new nanoc site.</p>

NOTE: nanoc also provides a <span class="command">nanoc create-item</span> command that can be used to create new items. However, it doesn’t do anything more than creating a new file for you. In nanoc 4.0, the <span class="command">create-item</span> and <span class="command">create-layout</span> commands will be removed.

Recompile the site by issuing <kbd>nanoc</kbd>. Notice that nanoc creates a file <span class="filename">output/about/index.html</span>. Open <span class="uri">http://localhost:3000/about/</span> in your browser, and admire your brand new about page. Shiny!

TIP: If you do not like having a metadata section at the top of every page (perhaps because it breaks syntax highlighting), you can put the metadata in a YAML file with the same name as the page itself. For example, the <span class="filename">content/about.html</span> page can have its metadata stored in <span class="filename">content/about.yaml</span> instead.

Customize the layout
--------------------

The look and feel of a site is defined in layouts. Open the site’s default (and only) layout, <span class="filename">layouts/default.html</span>, your text editor. It *almost* looks like a HTML page, except for the frontmatter at the top of the file, and eRuby (Embedded Ruby) instructions such as the `<%= yield %>` one:

    #!html
    …
    <div id="main">
      <%= yield %>
    </div>
    …

Two main eRuby instructions exist:

`<% code %>`
:   Runs the code between `<%` and `%>`

`<%= code %>`
:   Runs the code between `<%=` and `%>`, and displays the return value on the web page

TIP: nanoc is not limited to eRuby. It comes with support for Haml and Mustache, and adding support for other layout engines is easy using filters, which are explained in the <a href="#write-pages-in-markdown">Write pages in Markdown</a> section below.

The `<%= yield %>` instruction is replaced with the item’s compiled content when compiling.

The file also contains the `<%= @item[:title] %>` instruction near the top of the file. This is replaced with the contents of the <span class="filename">title</span> attribute during compilation.

Because nanoc attributes are free-form, you can make up your own attributes. Set the <span class="attribute">author</span> attribute on the about page:

    #!yaml
    ---
    title: "About me and my cats"
    author: "John Doe"
    ---

Modify the layout to show the value of the <span class="attribute">author</span> attribute. Add the following snippet to the layout:

    #!html
    <% if @item[:author] %>
      <p>This page was written by <%= @item[:author] %>.</p>
    <% end %>

Recompile the site and open both the home page and the about page. The about page contains a paragraph mentioning John Doe as the author, while the home page does not.

Write pages in Markdown
-----------------------

nanoc has <span class="firstterm">filters</span>, which transform content from one format into another.

A language that is commonly used instead of HTML is [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). nanoc comes with several different Markdown filters, including a filter for [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/), a fast and featureful Markdown processor.

Get rid of the content in <span class="filename">content/index.html</span> (but leave the frontmatter intact), and replace it with Markdown:

    ---
    title: "Denis’ Guide to Awesomeness"
    ---

    Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. This is just a regular paragraph.

    ## Shopping list

    1. Bread
    2. Butter
    3. Refined uranium

Rename the <span class="filename">content/index.html</span> file to <span class="filename">content/index.md</span>. <span class="filename">md</span> is a file extension that is commonly used with Markdown.

Before we can use the <span class="productname">kramdown</span> gem, it needs to be installed:

<pre><span class="prompt">%</span> <kbd>gem install kramdown</kbd></pre>

NOTE: {sudo-gem-install}

The <span class="filename">Rules</span> file is used to describe the processing rules for items and layouts. This is the file that needs to be modified in order to tell nanoc to use the kramdown filter.

The first point of interest in the <span class="filename">Rules</span> is this <span class="firstterm">compilation rule</span>:

    #!ruby
    compile '*' do
      if item[:extension] == 'css'
        # don’t filter stylesheets
      elsif item.binary?
        # don’t filter binary items
      else
        filter :erb
        layout 'default'
      end
    end

The second point of interest is the <span class="firstterm">routing rule</span>:

    #!ruby
    route '*' do
      if item[:extension] == 'css'
        # Write item with identifier /foo/ to /foo.css
        item.identifier.chop + '.css'
      elsif item.binary?
        # Write item with identifier /foo/ to /foo.ext
        item.identifier.chop + '.' + item[:extension]
      else
        # Write item with identifier /foo/ to /foo/index.html
        item.identifier + 'index.html'
      end
    end

Compilation rules describe how items are processed, while routing rule describe where items are written to. Each item matches exactly one compilation rule and one routing rule.

The string argument defines what items will be processed using this rule. The `*` wildcard matches zero or more characters, so in this case, both rules match all items.

Modify the compilation rule to add a check for the <span class="filename">md</span> file extension. In this case, run the `:kramdown` filter on items that have a <span class="filename">md</span> extension, and apply the default layout:

    #!ruby
    compile '*' do
      if item[:extension] == 'md'
        filter :kramdown
        layout 'default'
      elsif item[:extension] == 'css'
        # don’t filter stylesheets
      elsif item.binary?
        # don’t filter binary items
      else
        filter :erb
        layout 'default'
      end
    end

The routing rule still matches our needs, so keep that one intact.

Recompile the site and load the home page in your web browser. You’ll see a paragraph, a header and a list. In <span class="filename">output/index.html</span>, you will find the converted HTML:

    #!html
    <p>Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. This is just a regular paragraph.</p>

    <h2 id="shopping-list">Shopping list</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Bread</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Refined uranium</li>
    </ol>

Write some custom code
----------------------

nanoc will load Ruby source files in the <span class="filename">lib/</span> directory on startup. Functions defined in there will be available during compilation. Such functions are useful for removing logic from layouts.

To demonstrate this, open <span class="filename">content/about.html</span> and add tags to the frontmatter:

    #!yaml
    tags:
      - foo
      - bar
      - baz

Next, create a <span class="filename">lib/tags.rb</span> file and put in the following function:

    #!ruby
    def tags
      if @item[:tags].nil?
        '(none)'
      else
        @item[:tags].join(', ')
      end
    end

Modify the layout and add a paragraph that outputs the tags:

    #!html
    <p>Tags: <%= tags %></p>

Recompile the site and open both the home page and the about page in your web browser. You’ll see a list of tags on both pages.

Use a predefined helper
-----------------------

nanoc is bundled with a handful of helpers, including [a tagging helper](/docs/reference/helpers/#tagging). To use this tagging helper, replace the contents of <span class="filename">lib/tags.rb</span> with this:

    #!ruby
    include Nanoc::Helpers::Tagging

This will make all functions defined in the `Nanoc::Helpers::Tagging` module available for use.

Modify the layout and replace the paragraph that dispays the tags with a call to `#tags_for`, which is defined in the tagging helper:

    #!html
    <p>Tags: <%= tags_for(@item) %></p>

Recompile the site. The tags in the compiled HTML files in the <span class="filename">output/</span> directory are now generated using the helper.
